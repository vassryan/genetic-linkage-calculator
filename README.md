# genetic-linkage-calculator
This project takes in genetic recombination data as input in the following format:
Line 1: # of test cases
Line 2: 3 chosen symbols for genes in lower case (Ex: "v cv ct")
Lines 3-10: Genotype and offspring count separated by * (Ex: "v*CV*CT*580")

Note: the program is not completely functional yet. Much of the framework for the solution has been made,
but the final calculations and the final print statements are not yet implemented.
